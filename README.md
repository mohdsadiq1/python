<p>Here's a simple Python API using Flask that prints the reverse of the origin IP address:</p>
To run this code, you'll need to install Flask if you haven't already: <br/>
<b>pip install flask</b> <br/>
Then you can save the code in a file (e.g., app.py) and run it using: <br/>
<b>python app.py</b> <br/>

API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. When you make a request to this endpoint, it will print the reverse of the origin IP address in the response.
